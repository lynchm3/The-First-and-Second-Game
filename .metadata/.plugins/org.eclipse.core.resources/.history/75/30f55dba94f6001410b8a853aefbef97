	Tactical RPG, Strategy RPG
	
	
	Gangs makes sense for the numbers
	
	You can make it incredibly difficult for yourself to win the game by pissing everyone off
	
	If the game is easy, you're probably an asshole
	
	After battle the supporting cast stand still, or move to a place they wont be on the way,
	you can move around with the main character and talk to people, collect items and shit,
	you can collect the items or recruit people during battle too
	
	You can use your whole gang in every battle, none of this picking x% of your force bullshit,
	this makes recruiting peeps way more important, will lower levels maybe? Just leave it organic...
	
	Interesting leveling system like FF10
	
	Enemy faction that's good at magic, one that's good at swords etc, so that you can choose to fight one
	based on your abilities or whatevs
	
	Mission briefing that tells you what you'll come up against, have ridiculous shit like "magic users only" or "100 weak cunts"
	
	Ascii art fun here and there?
	
	Coming on to women for comedic effect
	
	Bestiary
	
	Ability to investigate enemy details and stats, the higher the level of the power, the more u can see
	Once an enemy is investigated, always see the deets of that type of bbad guy from then on
	
	Some levels that are way too easy (level w/ 100 lvl 1)(level w/ 1 lvl 100)
	
	Start with nothing. Get map in first lvl (just to make it clear u'll get stuff.
	Then u get compass, eh... bike... horse... stuff...
	
	Need more maps to unlock more areas????
	
	Secret areas, secret recruits, side quests
	
	Option to investigate area (ability like investigating enemies)
	
	General population count as a faction adn will help/hinder/attack you
	
	Areas way above your level are available, mission level shown in briefing
	Or... like... enemy level range (enemy lvl 10 - 17)
	Level range colour coded
	
	Engagement previews
	
	faction/gang/group/... what sounds better?
	
	Push enemies off cliffs
	
	terrain - mountains, grass, swamp. Give attack/defense bonuses.....
	
	Flying units?
	
	Style for speach - Giant pixelated heads on tiny bodies
	
	Idea for how to make characters easily -> take photos or stuff and pixelate them
	
	Button to turn on/off squares enemies can attack
	
	Button to auto equip best anti-magic shit for character/whole army
	
	Class changes on lvl 10/20 something.... branching class chnages :P
	
	Classless??? (like skyrim) everyone can use everything... but if their abilities are low they'll be shit at it
	When you recruit someone though, they already have some stats... which will ind of say what they are unofficially...
	They all have "titles" which are just text that gives some indication of what they do
	but dont have any pratical effect "TITLES" not "CLASSES"
	
	Show how many steps u'll be taking when u move (telepath tactics)
	undo? (telepath tactics)
	rotate (telepath tactics)
	character done (telepath tactics)
	inventory (telepath tactics)`
	selection of weapon (telepath tactics) BUT, the weapon selection should maybe pop up beside ur mouse after moving?... but this will block squares and further movement
	interact with enviroment(TT)
	Destroy objects(TT)
	actions menu (e.g. grab, force pull, force push) (TT) lots of potential... :P
	telekinesis (TT)
	status screen when u right click a charater (TT)
	objects hold items (TT) what else could items do.....
	Rally button (TT)
	Next character button (TT)
	Normal VS Casual mode? (TT) - i think i should have only one mode, permadeath, all the best games in the world only have one difficulty level...
	Sprint (TT)
	Set trap (TT)
	
	Traps!
	Squares u dont want to stand on, so you move around them.
	
	None of this fucking bullshit fantasy long names crap fucking lore bullshit
	No huge amounts of text
	Especially at the very start
	
	No tutorial -> integrate tutorial in to the game
	w/o pointless exposure... just like... put a box in the way, let them work it out that they have to move it or destroy it
	Maybe follow a friendly character. Maybe see them do things and emulate
	Maybe they prank u and move a box in ur way during their turn, and u have to move it out of ur way...
	UI and game is just so fucking user friendy u dont need a manual or obvious tutorial
	DOnt make the qtutorial hunting... be more fucking imaginative, tutorials are always people fucking hunting
	
	Huge battle with multiple factions on huge map
	
	Depending on who a faction hates more, they may let their emotions affect them and attack who they hate rather than who's the best to attack strategically
	Just like u might do to someone who really pissed u off.
	
	Descriptive shit all the time interspersed with text "panting heavily" LIKE the robot in kotor2
	
	Researching shit?
	
	List of things to do over end turn button (like civ - choose research, choose production, move unit)
	
	Base camp u ugrade and maintain?
	
	Running vs walking?
	
	Crafting?!? :P (thinking something like DA:inquisition
	
	Species like dragon run, telepath tactics? 
	Each species has strengths weakness - like SKYRIM
	
	Level editor
	Campaign creator
	
	Rape and allusion to rape. Darkedge to the game.
	
	Gain experience for EVERYTHING
	exploring, using abilities, completing level, completing external mission, finding a secret, unlocking a secret, recruiting... EVERYTHING
	for placing a trap
	Regain all health on lvl up?! ...the more rules the more strategy and depth to the game.....
	
	ability to open chests, in TT u have to destroy them :/
	but... u should be able to destroy them too
	and there should be locked ones...
	
	An enemy that talks a big game then tries to run away when nearly dead...
	
	
	O o o... enemies that run away, and u see them later on in different battles if u dont manage to kill them as they are running away
	They run away coz their personal health is low... or coz they've lost most of their army...
	Or coz u completed and objective...
	Or just coz they're fucking smart
	
	Friendly areas... towns... is (TT) doing this?
	they don't ALL have to become warzones!!
	BUT in the towns u can also attack people
	They'll all turn on u, but u can fucking do it.
	INTERACTIVE ORGANIC ENVIROMENT (ORGANIC NOT IN THE PLANT WAY :D)
	ORGANIC INTERACTION WITH THE ENVIROMENT AND PEOPLE AND ANIMALS AND PLANTS... AND ROCKS
	Maybe throw in a little crate puzzle in a town, just one in the whole game, and make it super hard :D
	
	Lame jokes
	Put in loads of lame jokes
	Just look up stupid fucking jokes
	dad jokes
	anything
	have people say them
	
	GAMPLAY FIRST... story and graphics and shit secondary
	
	Oblivion style stories... intrigue and trickery and espionage and sillyness
	
	How will stealth work in my game?
	
	Beer references
	sex references
	drug references
	
	A seasoned vet/drinker/person taking advantage intellectually/monetarily of a naive moron
	
	Evil people that if u were to start wa fight in a town they might ignore the fighting or join in on ur side (the bad side)
	
	I'm gonna need to make a decision on when u can save and how perma permadeath actually is... what does TT do?
	
	Destroy peoaple s property and they react
	
	Police? Go back to a town and kill everyone once u've leveled up high enough.
	
	travel areas after the fact, if u unlock a new anility
	Feeling a bit like dragonrun. but witht he ability to revisit areas.
	I'm I taking the risk away? And taking difficult decisions away?
	I think the difficult decision just have to take a different form other than limitations coz the game is soooopid.
	
	Put a chest in one of the very early areas thats impossible for u to open at the time
	That you'll eventually be able to open.
	And if u remember to go back to it hours later there's something SWEET in the chest. A PERSON! A PERSON HAS BEEN STUCK IN THE CHEST THE WHOLE TIME! COZ THEY'RE MAGIC OR A COCKROACH OR SOMETHING.
	
	Mission briefing (area briefing) also has info about the chests, and breakable objects.
	Need to tell them when area isclear so that they dont feel the need to break EVERYTHING.
	COZ EVERYTHING IS BREAKABLE.
	
	And u can jump. how can u save the world if u cant jumP!?
	Jumpng ability w/ different levels of height
	
	Climbing ability
	
	Non-human recruits. Dogs, horses, antellopes, cockroaches, BADGERS!!! ...imps, gremlins, monsters on ur team
	
	Pets, mind control
	Super mutant (Fallout 3)
	
	CLEAR tags on areas where yu've done everything and killed everyone.
	
	
	Can i get up on kickstarter once i've got some graphics and shit to show people?
	
	TT is really missing a world map.....
	
	Show full area map b4 getting them to choose people (maybe u might want someone who can climb that cliff and is good at magic and can sneak (Fire Emblem)
	
	Icon for the fucking application (TT doesnt have one)
	
	BUT... atleast one of the villages actually should get attacked...
	
	You can send one of your minions to clear up an area that isnt CLEARED
	Button (Clear out chests)(Collect wood)(collect stone)
	Ofcourse, they lvl up from this
	COllect +-5 wood (takes +- 10 mins)... or somehting...
	mining... lumberjack... lockpicking ability
	
	For each area - lumber, chests, rocks remaining, quests remaining, people to talk to remaining.... UNKNOWN remaining (i.e. come back laterz...)
	
	Recuits will come for all types of events
	Main caharacter reached lvl 10 - steve joins ur crew
	Ur HQ is upgraded to a castles - alan joins ur crew
	...
	
	Awful PUNS
	
	Damage falloff based on how far ur ranged attack is firing from
	
	Doors
	
	Something i dont like in TT, i have no idea how the fuck to open chests
	There should just be a contextual button over the chest/door that u can tap to interact
	Does it cost an action point!? ...hm
	
	Tap enemy to see their move/attack range, tap a gain to turn off, so u can select a few easily (TT i think)
	
	Option to skip intro text for area coz u've already fucking seen it and dont want to click 20 times to get back in to the action. (They all pull this bullshit)
	("Start Battle" button)
	
	Can allies move through eachother? i think it's fucking annoying if they cant...
	
	Put the end turn button somewhere away from where the "done with this character" button is, i keep nearly pressing end turn
	
	Ye... TT needs a break... its just constant fighting
	Also... in that first village the bad guys just fucking pegged it after i hit one of their guys once...
	That is bullshit
	They all should have needed to make it to the edge of the map to escape.
	
	Formation selection like TT
	
	Character fighters should be unique, unlike TT
	Have different colours!?
	Also... the TT portraits are fucking shite
	
	Factions that dont hate u will give u presents?
	If u fuck a faction that another faction hates, faction 2 will give u an item or a recruit
	
	Gota be impossible to unlock all areas and get all recruits in a playthrough
	Certain decisions need to eliminate other options
	Block off areas (and therefore recruits and items get blocked off too)
	You should be given a decent amount of info about what you'll lose when u block off an area.
	(This area is high in magical energy and contains the mages guild... fo e.g.)
	(So u can guess that u woud have gotten some magic items and magic recruits if u hadnt blocked it off)
	
	Need to give the user lots of information before they make a decision
	OR RATHER... make lots of information available to the user if they choose to find it, read it, use it
	"Legend talks of a very powerful hermit mage in the mountains of BLABLABLA"... u can infer from that that if u want this mage, maybe dont block up the area...
	
	IF you stop some friendlies from dying they'll come talk to u at the end of the 
	
	Talkign to characters during battle
	AGAIN... if I place the player next to an enemy they can talk to at the start of the battle and have
	that context sensitive button appear on them to show that u cn talk to them... i dont have to eplain it in a stupid tutorial popup then
	
	NEED zooming with the mouse wheel
	i NEED to zoom al the way in and out. TT mouse wheel switches players. BULLSHIT.
	
	Weird interesting one off objects in levels. not just fucking boring hests and trees
	
	Make status windows and actions windows and shit like that moveable
	
	Undo lets u see if u can talk to characters and if u can interact with an object without getting fucked
	
	REVIVE magic... pheonix down... that adds an extra level of complexity
	Limited number of phoenix down
	revive magic costs TONNES of magic...
	hmmmmmm
	make it possible... but EXPENSIVE to carry out
	
	When u kill an enemy commander his crew get weak... or run away... and u have to chase them down
	
	A level where u have to chase down fleeing pussies while on horseback.
	If u leave them alone and let them all run away u get some sort of reward
	
	knocked out neutrals/allies at the start of the battle that u can heal
	
	ENCOURAGE EXPERIMENTATION FROM THE PLAYER
	
	THe attack preview in TT is WEAK
	Doesnt seem to tell me if i'll be counter attacked
	
	counter attacks
	
	movement after attacks? for all? for horses? for those with the ability?
	
	enter/esc for dialogs
	
	I think only backstabs adding extra damage and sidestabs not adding extra damage is good,
	only having to protext in one cardinal direction is much more managable
	
	Highlight an enemies weaknesses when looking at their stats.
	SEVERE WEAKNESS TO FIRE
	
	OOOO...
	elemental shit
	weakness to fire/electricity/shit
	
	Bosses need weaknesses too, otherwise all ur concentration on weaknesses is bullcrap
	
	side mission to remove bosses/factions resistace to X
	
	The hover to view info is shite in TT.
	I want hover to give me shit tonnes of info
	or make it configurable how much info is in TOOLTIPS
	
	MAKE EVERYTHING CONFIGURABLE SO THAT PEOPLE CANT BLAME U FOR SHIT
	
	TT gives u dropped loot for last bad guy u kill rather than just leaving it there :D
	
	STATS
	Stats at end of each battle
	Stats in main menu
	Silly stats
	Super specific stats (coz super specific stats are funny in and of themselves)(chickens stabbed...)
	
	At the very leats... when u make life difficult for yourself it will be very difficult to keep EVERYONE alive
	:D feeling evil :D
	
	A character that's SUPER (189) years old... coz... and they are SUPER jadded/skeptical
	
	NPC i saved refereneced how they would not have survived if it wasnt for me. NICE TOUCH (TT)
	
	People who leave coz of shit you've done
	happened really annoyingly in (TT) coz i was too bust helping the oppressed?!?!
	Maybe she always leaves? Louise Legerdemain
	OK... she didnt leave in the end :D ...but put it in to awesome mark tactics advence
	
	A merchant!
	ok... so they have merchants in TT and Fire Emblem...
	But what if i could call my merchant in to battle
	and if he dies i'm FUCKED.
	BUT there's always the option
	and maybe sometimes theres a reason to bring him!!!?
	have "These people respond well to merchants" in the mission briefing (but something less gay and obvious than that)
	
	In the mission briefing, make it obvious enough for the user to work out who to bring
	"This is where Steve was born", "This is where John did a stint as a bar tender"... ETC.
	Maybe they have to cross reference the mission briefing with our journal... "Someone who likes cats will do well here".
	
	Quote from TT -
	"Weapons so sharp they cut their own prices" :D thats good shit
	
	dialouge options with characteres with characters.
	INCLUDING
	iteresting dialogue choices with stock chars (merchants, recruiters)
	TT - What interesting deals do u have? - said to a trader
	
	I want to have a recruitment agency you can hire from, but make it clear that
	every hire is a special one-off hire and u cant just keep going back w/ money and gettng more and more mages for e.g.
	Maybe naming them well and making them expensive and having them talk to u about their alignment and interests will show that
	ALL available fromt he get-go, none unlocked. but cost moooolah
	
	Items that give u new abilities
	(Grappling hook in TT!)
	
	When buying there NEEEDS to be a screen that shows each char would benefit from that armour (TT fucked this)
	
	Icon besde each char to show what they are best at
	Or maybe like... beside their portrait show an ordered list of what theyre specialities lie :D
	SWORD
	AXE
	FIREMAGIC
	BOW
	..in icon form, as many as u can fit
	
	Another funny line from TT
	"Do we have to go to the human village"
	"Don't call it huan village, just 'village!'"
	made  me think
	
	Speach bubbles need to come fromt he character thats talking... TT doesnt do thsis
	
	AND ENTER needs to continue convo... TT doesnt
	
	make it obvious that u can convert an enemy thru dialogue
	
	ALLOW THE USER TO MAKE DECISION BASED ON THEIR PREFERRED PLAY STYLE (lots of abilities and leveling options)
	
	cpg 0105
	
	LEVEL(S) with alarm that tells all of ur peresence
	its a physical thing that they can press and u have to stop them getting there
	it can be disabled
	AGAIN... this shit needs to be made clear and obvious to the user
	
	Show enemie's field of view!?
	
	Field of view like massive chalice!?
	
	IS letting all users do all too musch to take in!?
	
	Also... TT battle preview doesnt tell me the chances of one of the chars being killed
	doesnt tell me their total health VS damage potential
	
	I want to show char lvl and highest stat at all times
	
	No mana, just actions per turn, in TT i'm hitting end turn repeatedly 
	
	Dont force any difficult decision on the player until 1/3 in to the game
	Gotta drag them in b4 bombarding them with guilt and death
	
	Nee to make clear the counter attack rules, i have no idea whats happening in TT
	
	Gain XP for counters
	
	Actually... handle battle like in fire emblem
	
	Push/shove should do minor damage, in TT is does none, and maybe lower their attack/def for the next round
	
	U DONT HAVE TO FAIL A MISSION TO WORK OUT WHATS NEEDED
	mission briefing, scouting, knowledge, obviousness
	
	TT is too hard and harsh and unobvious
	all it needs is "We're going to need to save him fast, our presence won't go unnoticed for long"
	
	In battle preview show that factions level of hatred/ love towards u
	an attack brings the level to neg value (#hatred ;) )
	
	Cumultive stats? e.g. add together scouting ability of all allies to caclulate how much info should be in briefing
	e.g. add together knowledge stat of recruits to calculate how much deets should be shown about enemies
	
	Mave text boxes pop up just beside ur char as u walk around, dont pause play... BASTION DOES THIS?!?! (makes it awkward to read though...)
	
	Genetic mutation involved?!
	
	SKYRIM - get better at stuff based on how much u use it rather than choosing on lvl up. (still gonna need to give the user choice for some stuff .in skyrim perks and magic VS strngth VS dex....
	
	Combos or teamwork... (chroma squad)
	
	relationships w/ other chars? (fire emblem)
	
	MOTEHRFUVKING foreshadowing
	see people ur gonna meet later
	see monsters flutter by that ur gonna fight later
	
	Monster murdering contracts (witcher)
	Also... just contracts in general... with a jobs boards (witcher)
	
	In chroma squad they dont stop moving and it gives me a headached... (chroma squad)
	
	Visit a recruits hometown homestown
	
	if u run out of ideas for stories and sidequests just play some rpgs (oblivion and gta spring to mind)
	
	CHroma squad heaps too much on you at the start without giving u info on how valuable the stats and valus actually are
	It tells you how much things will cost and whats stats will be affected without any reference of what that actually means...
	
	autosave obvs
	
	If there are specfic objectives they need to be on the screen at all times
	and obviously the status of those objecties need to be displayed
	display the objectives at all times!!!
	
	Random dialog from charactersduring battle, just saying stuff
	
	"Hold A to skip to battle" ...which shows up if they tap anything during a cutscene or dialog
	
	SOme chars have unique abilities? like... a ..... "SCANNER" :O (for a robot, got the idea from chroma squad)
	
	Chroma squad and TT arent close enough to top down, makes it hard to target stuff with the mouse
	
	The salesman should be unlocked later down the line, 1/4 thru the game
	
	Bonus subobjectives (chroma squad) get u ORGANIC bonus shit
	Some sort of ongoing stat to upkeep? like chroma squad? profit? fans? for doing things a ceratin way?
	Rating based on ur performance? chroma squad does this well
	
	Teamwork button like chroma squad? or somethimg similar and better?
	
	The problem w/ chroma squad is that it's just not clear.
	The rules need to be layed out clearly
	the tricky bit needs to be using those rules to your advantage, not working out the rules
	
	light affecting stealth?
	areas with no light that bitches can hide in and surprise attack?
