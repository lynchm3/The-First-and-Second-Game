	 Try the cartoon effect but put accessories on the subject first
	 goggle and guns and ammo beltes over the shoulder and a bow and
	 a sword and bow and book and shit, blindfold for a blind person
	 someone in a full super hero costume
	 and make the cartoon effect grittier (look up a ps tutorial on making shit gritty)
	 
	 
	 AND different expressions!
	 
	 i can also... afer cartooning... swap facial features and give emotions... leave the face creepy blank then swap nose mouth and eyes
	 
	 also... large outer outslines would be cool stroke 5px is nice
	 
	 ALSO those boxes around her, so that the missing arms are les obvious... :D
