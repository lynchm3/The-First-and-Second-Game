	 For all these, have a few references from popular/unpopular media to draw on
	 They should be fucked up versions of their usual tropes/stereotypes
	 The fucked up ness brings sadness and funnys
	 Multiple character ideas below could be merged into one
	 Dont let them be 1 dimensional
	 u should find these people in the middle of their acts (superheroing, torturing, ...)
	 maybe every character has their own unique ability - torture, scavenging, lockpicking, set shit on fire
	 tHEIR ABILITIES AND STATS NEED TO TIE IN TO THEIR STORIES
	 IS UR CHARACTER ACTUALLY A CHARACTER WHO FIGHTS OR MORE OF A MANAGER/COMMANDER TYPE?
	 THEIR TITLES SHOULD BE SUPER-COMPLIMENTARY "ADVISOR TO KINGS" - BUT ALL THE KINGS DIED HORRIBLY :d OR LOST THEIR WEALTH, OT GOT LOST :D
	 IF THE RIGHT CHARACTER  IS AROUND FOR THE RIGHT EVENT THEY'LL POP IN WITH INFO OR BONUS OR SOMETHING
	 MAYNE WAYS TO GET INJURED AND MISS THE NECT ATTLE?

	 SUPERHERO
	 Nutcase superhero who gets the shit kicked out of them
	 Believes in nt killing
	 daredevil style
	 Leaves enemies alive, but knocked out, so they can be questioned
	 Old school superhero style, but in the real world, so not so super,
	 genuinely a danger to themselves and others

	 uses a wrench or baseball bat or some shit
	 
	 TORTURER
	 Will take captives
	 (people knocked out by the superhero or others... maybe sometimes bad guy surrender)

	 (Is there a character like this in media that i can draw on??)
	 Saw
	 Human centipede
	 Can get information that a good scout would get, could be used if ur scouting ability is shite.
	 you find him in the act of torturing an innocent and can decide there and then to recruit (talk), kill, or talk then kill
	 in some room u can ee during a mision
	 (ramsay snow)
	 
	 BROKEN TORTURE VICTIM
	 maybe u could choose between him and the torturere, hes not nearly as powerful
	 !!! show their levels below them, so that when ur choosing u can see the tortutre is stronger :D
	 if u choose the toturer he'll "finish up here" and kill his captive
	 (theon greyjoy)
