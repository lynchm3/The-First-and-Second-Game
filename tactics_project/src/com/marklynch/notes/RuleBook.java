	// How do counters work!?
	// If a unit is attacked and they have a weapon that can reach the attacked,
	// they will automatically attack with the best weapon that can reach.
	// Will this work with a weapon triangle + being able to equip any weapon?
	// In FE it was really annoying that u countered with the last weapon used
	// (some units could equip sword + axe)
	// If I make weapon proficiency a big deal dat could fix shit.
	// Could become a game of ranges...
	// Can only counter once per turn?

	// Can you pass through units of the same faction?
	// When I couldn't do this in TT it REALLY annoyed me.
	// Pretty sure u can do i in fire emblem... will check

	// HOW DO TURNS WORK?
	// faction by faction(FE, TT)? Player by player based on speed (BB)?

	// WEAPON TRIANGLES?
	// Am I doing weapon trianlges? it feels like a purely FE thing... look up
	// examples of weapons triangle online? OR like pokemon - complicated
	// relations
	// between types...

	// COUNTERS?
	// If there weren't counters previews would be easier to show
