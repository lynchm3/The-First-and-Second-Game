	// TT doesnt show squares u can attack the way FE does (is there a reason
	// behind this? find another game that does it...)

	// RPGs that dont show u comparisons EVERYWHERE (should be in crafting, shop
	// and inventory screens!)

	// TT characters look the fucking same

	// Witcher - items aren't broken down in to nearly enough categories

	// RPGS - constant trecks to the fecking shop to sell off ur crap,
	// especially in late game (witcher, skyrim, DA:I)
