	// TT doesnt show squares u can attack the way FE does (is there a reason
	// behind this? find another game that does it...)

	// RPGs that dont show u comparisons EVERYWHERE (should be in crafting, shop
	// and inventory screens!)

	// Boring fucking walls of text from boring fucking charactes (FE)

	// Slimey fucking NPCs that come in behind you with no warning, oneshotting
	// your back line so that u have to restart (FE)

	// When you get to a point in these games where you have more troops than
	// you can use... Do u train all or focus on a few? THere's no way to know.
	// U
	// need to be able to tell the future. My game needs to let you use all your
	// troops, and push you, to use all your troops. In the other games you
	// don't know if the max will change or stay the same, and what the max will
	// be in the end (FE,TT)

	// Special moves that you never use coz the hit chance is so low, only time
	// it would actually hit is against a weak guy u wouldnt need to use it on
	// (BB)

	// No direction, no leads. Not that u should have to follow them, just a
	// guaranteed doable quest. (BB)
