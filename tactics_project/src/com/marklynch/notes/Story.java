	// How about...A cover up for something smallish, like a murder o a supposed
	// innocent/nobody snowballs out of control. That's a nugget. That's where
	// the nugget comes from. It could happen to anyone. No... not murder...
	// manslaughter... where he didnt have a choice... not even manslaughter...
	// accidental death... but that looks like murder... when he was trying to
	// save her. OR is this the true story!? He could explain his side first,
	// then someone goes "He's nothing but a murderer"... bu they don't know the
	// full story. (Gamewise u could choose whether to kill someone or not). How
	// do they go from non-killers to murdering without a second thought? Coz
	// thats what they all do in this game... they murder without a second
	// thought. Fire Emblem is all cutesy doing it too. It's just like "stab
	// stab
	// stab lol, now lets go have a cutesy convo back at our camp of murderers"

	// Soon there won't be enough pie to go around and corporations that used to
	// in somewhat peace along side eachother are now all grasping the same
	// pieces of pie. The masses have been pushed to basically enslavement, to
	// the breaking point, and when they couldn't squeeze the people anymore for
	// profit they began squeezing eachother. WHich eventually led to their
	// collapse. Or stalemate. Or unification.
	// "When they couldn't push down anymore, they pushed out against eachother
	// and were met with resistance"
	// This whole enslavement of people though... eh... What about the robots.

	// Maybe that the thing to explore. Not the magic bipedal robots like in
	// iRobot... but like... people being replaced by trucks and stuff. If there
	// actually research to show that tech always creates new jobs? Is that
	// research relevant to present now? Have we seen it all before or this a
	// whole new thing.
