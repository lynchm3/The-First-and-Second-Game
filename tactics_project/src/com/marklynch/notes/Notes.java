	/*
	 * FE MEETS TOTAL WAR MEETS XCOM :D ? - ye, sure, no biggy
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Tactical RPG, Strategy RPG
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Gangs makes sense for the numbers
	 * 
	 * You can make it incredibly difficult for yourself to win the game by
	 * pissing everyone off
	 * 
	 * If the game is easy, you're probably an asshole
	 * 
	 * If can't reach target, fall back to reachable enemy that's closest to
	 * target
	 * 
	 * If can't attack target, fall back to enemy that's closest
	 * 
	 * After battle the supporting cast stand still, or move to a place they
	 * wont be on the way, you can move around with the main character and talk
	 * to people, collect items and shit, you can collect the items or recruit
	 * people during battle too
	 * 
	 * You can use your whole gang in every battle, none of this picking x% of
	 * your force bullshit, this makes recruiting peeps way more important, will
	 * lower levels maybe? Just leave it organic...
	 * 
	 * Interesting leveling system like FF10
	 * 
	 * Enemy faction that's good at magic, one that's good at swords etc, so
	 * that you can choose to fight one based on your abilities or whatevs
	 * 
	 * Mission briefing that tells you what you'll come up against, have
	 * ridiculous shit like "magic users only" or "100 weak cunts", in BB i had
	 * to cancel missions coz they turned out to be impossible after accepting
	 * them (of the games own admittance.
	 * 
	 * Ascii art fun here and there?
	 * 
	 * Coming on to women for comedic effect
	 * 
	 * Bestiary (for beasts and humans alike)
	 * 
	 * Remember to use loadlocal and load global images
	 * 
	 * Ability to investigate enemy details and stats, the higher the level of
	 * the power, the more u can see Once an enemy is investigated, always see
	 * the deets of that type of bbad guy from then on
	 * 
	 * Some levels that are way too easy (level w/ 100 lvl 1)(level w/ 1 lvl
	 * 100)
	 * 
	 * Start with nothing. Get map in first lvl (just to make it clear u'll get
	 * stuff. Then u get compass, eh... bike... horse... stuff...
	 * 
	 * Need more maps to unlock more areas????
	 * 
	 * Secret areas, secret recruits, side quests
	 * 
	 * Option to investigate area (ability like investigating enemies)
	 * 
	 * General population count as a faction adn will help/hinder/attack you
	 * 
	 * Areas way above your level are available, mission level shown in briefing
	 * Or... like... enemy level range (enemy lvl 10 - 17) Level range colour
	 * coded
	 * 
	 * Engagement previews
	 * 
	 * faction/gang/group/... what sounds better?
	 * 
	 * Push enemies off cliffs
	 * 
	 * terrain - mountains, grass, swamp. Give attack/defense bonuses.....
	 * 
	 * Flying units?
	 * 
	 * Style for speach - Giant pixelated heads on tiny bodies
	 * 
	 * Idea for how to make characters easily -> take photos or stuff and
	 * pixelate them
	 * 
	 * Button to turn on/off squares enemies can attack
	 * 
	 * Button to auto equip best anti-magic shit for character/whole army
	 * 
	 * Class changes on lvl 10/20 something.... branching class chnages :P
	 * 
	 * Classless??? (like skyrim) everyone can use everything... but if their
	 * abilities are low they'll be shit at it When you recruit someone though,
	 * they already have some stats... which will ind of say what they are
	 * unofficially... They all have "titles" which are just text that gives
	 * some indication of what they do but dont have any pratical effect
	 * "TITLES" not "CLASSES"
	 * 
	 * Show how many steps u'll be taking when u move (telepath tactics) undo?
	 * (telepath tactics) rotate (telepath tactics) character done (telepath
	 * tactics) inventory (telepath tactics)` selection of weapon (telepath
	 * tactics) BUT, the weapon selection should maybe pop up beside ur mouse
	 * after moving?... but this will block squares and further movement
	 * interact with enviroment(TT) Destroy objects(TT) actions menu (e.g. grab,
	 * force pull, force push) (TT) lots of potential... :P telekinesis (TT)
	 * status screen when u right click a charater (TT) objects hold items (TT)
	 * what else could items do..... Rally button (TT) Next character button
	 * (TT) Normal VS Casual mode? (TT) - i think i should have only one mode,
	 * permadeath, all the best games in the world only have one difficulty
	 * level... Sprint (TT) Set trap (TT)
	 * 
	 * Traps! Squares u dont want to stand on, so you move around them.
	 * 
	 * None of this fucking bullshit fantasy long names crap fucking lore
	 * bullshit No huge amounts of text Especially at the very start
	 * 
	 * No tutorial -> integrate tutorial in to the game w/o pointless
	 * exposure... just like... put a box in the way, let them work it out that
	 * they have to move it or destroy it Maybe follow a friendly character.
	 * Maybe see them do things and emulate Maybe they prank u and move a box in
	 * ur way during their turn, and u have to move it out of ur way... UI and
	 * game is just so fucking user friendy u dont need a manual or obvious
	 * tutorial DOnt make the qtutorial hunting... be more fucking imaginative,
	 * tutorials are always people fucking hunting
	 * 
	 * Huge battle with multiple factions on huge map
	 * 
	 * Depending on who a faction hates more, they may let their emotions affect
	 * them and attack who they hate rather than who's the best to attack
	 * strategically Just like u might do to someone who really pissed u off.
	 * 
	 * Descriptive shit all the time interspersed with text "panting heavily"
	 * LIKE the robot in kotor2
	 * 
	 * Researching shit?
	 * 
	 * List of things to do over end turn button (like civ - choose research,
	 * choose production, move unit)
	 * 
	 * Base camp u ugrade and maintain?
	 * 
	 * Running vs walking?
	 * 
	 * Crafting?!? :P (thinking something like DA:inquisition
	 * 
	 * Species like dragon run, telepath tactics? Each species has strengths
	 * weakness - like SKYRIM
	 * 
	 * Level editor Campaign creator
	 * 
	 * Rape and allusion to rape. Darkedge to the game.
	 * 
	 * Gain experience for EVERYTHING exploring, using abilities, completing
	 * level, completing external mission, finding a secret, unlocking a secret,
	 * recruiting... EVERYTHING for placing a trap Regain all health on lvl up?!
	 * ...the more rules the more strategy and depth to the game.....
	 * 
	 * ability to open chests, in TT u have to destroy them :/ but... u should
	 * be able to destroy them too and there should be locked ones...
	 * 
	 * An enemy that talks a big game then tries to run away when nearly dead...
	 * 
	 * 
	 * O o o... enemies that run away, and u see them later on in different
	 * battles if u dont manage to kill them as they are running away They run
	 * away coz their personal health is low... or coz they've lost most of
	 * their army... Or coz u completed and objective... Or just coz they're
	 * fucking smart
	 * 
	 * Friendly areas... towns... is (TT) doing this? they don't ALL have to
	 * become warzones!! BUT in the towns u can also attack people They'll all
	 * turn on u, but u can fucking do it. INTERACTIVE ORGANIC ENVIROMENT
	 * (ORGANIC NOT IN THE PLANT WAY :D) ORGANIC INTERACTION WITH THE ENVIROMENT
	 * AND PEOPLE AND ANIMALS AND PLANTS... AND ROCKS Maybe throw in a little
	 * crate puzzle in a town, just one in the whole game, and make it super
	 * hard :D
	 * 
	 * Lame jokes Put in loads of lame jokes Just look up stupid fucking jokes
	 * dad jokes anything have people say them
	 * 
	 * GAMPLAY FIRST... story and graphics and shit secondary
	 * 
	 * Oblivion style stories... intrigue and trickery and espionage and
	 * sillyness
	 * 
	 * How will stealth work in my game?
	 * 
	 * Beer references sex references drug references
	 * 
	 * A seasoned vet/drinker/person taking advantage intellectually/monetarily
	 * of a naive moron
	 * 
	 * Evil people that if u were to start wa fight in a town they might ignore
	 * the fighting or join in on ur side (the bad side)
	 * 
	 * I'm gonna need to make a decision on when u can save and how perma
	 * permadeath actually is... what does TT do?
	 * 
	 * Destroy peoaple s property and they react
	 * 
	 * Police? Go back to a town and kill everyone once u've leveled up high
	 * enough.
	 * 
	 * travel areas after the fact, if u unlock a new anility Feeling a bit like
	 * dragonrun. but witht he ability to revisit areas. I'm I taking the risk
	 * away? And taking difficult decisions away? I think the difficult decision
	 * just have to take a different form other than limitations coz the game is
	 * soooopid.
	 * 
	 * Put a chest in one of the very early areas thats impossible for u to open
	 * at the time That you'll eventually be able to open. And if u remember to
	 * go back to it hours later there's something SWEET in the chest. A PERSON!
	 * A PERSON HAS BEEN STUCK IN THE CHEST THE WHOLE TIME! COZ THEY'RE MAGIC OR
	 * A COCKROACH OR SOMETHING.
	 * 
	 * Mission briefing (area briefing) also has info about the chests, and
	 * breakable objects. Need to tell them when area isclear so that they dont
	 * feel the need to break EVERYTHING. COZ EVERYTHING IS BREAKABLE.
	 * 
	 * And u can jump. how can u save the world if u cant jumP!? Jumpng ability
	 * w/ different levels of height
	 * 
	 * Climbing ability
	 * 
	 * Non-human recruits. Dogs, horses, antellopes, cockroaches, BADGERS!!!
	 * ...imps, gremlins, monsters on ur team
	 * 
	 * Pets, mind control Super mutant (Fallout 3)
	 * 
	 * CLEAR tags on areas where yu've done everything and killed everyone.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Can i get up on kickstarter once i've got some graphics and shit to show
	 * people?
	 * 
	 * TT is really missing a world map.....
	 * 
	 * Show full area map b4 getting them to choose people (maybe u might want
	 * someone who can climb that cliff and is good at magic and can sneak (Fire
	 * Emblem)
	 * 
	 * Icon for the fucking application (TT doesnt have one)
	 * 
	 * BUT... atleast one of the villages actually should get attacked...
	 * 
	 * You can send one of your minions to clear up an area that isnt CLEARED
	 * Button (Clear out chests)(Collect wood)(collect stone) Ofcourse, they lvl
	 * up from this COllect +-5 wood (takes +- 10 mins)... or somehting...
	 * mining... lumberjack... lockpicking ability
	 * 
	 * For each area - lumber, chests, rocks remaining, quests remaining, people
	 * to talk to remaining.... UNKNOWN remaining (i.e. come back laterz...)
	 * 
	 * Recuits will come for all types of events Main caharacter reached lvl 10
	 * - steve joins ur crew Ur HQ is upgraded to a castles - alan joins ur crew
	 * ...
	 * 
	 * Awful PUNS
	 * 
	 * Damage falloff based on how far ur ranged attack is firing from
	 * 
	 * Doors
	 * 
	 * Something i dont like in TT, i have no idea how the fuck to open chests
	 * There should just be a contextual button over the chest/door that u can
	 * tap to interact Does it cost an action point!? ...hm
	 * 
	 * Tap enemy to see their move/attack range, tap a gain to turn off, so u
	 * can select a few easily (TT i think)
	 * 
	 * Option to skip intro text for area coz u've already fucking seen it and
	 * dont want to click 20 times to get back in to the action. (They all pull
	 * this bullshit) ("Start Battle" button)
	 * 
	 * Can allies move through eachother? i think it's fucking annoying if they
	 * cant...
	 * 
	 * Put the end turn button somewhere away from where the
	 * "done with this character" button is, i keep nearly pressing end turn
	 * 
	 * Ye... TT needs a break... its just constant fighting Also... in that
	 * first village the bad guys just fucking pegged it after i hit one of
	 * their guys once... That is bullshit They all should have needed to make
	 * it to the edge of the map to escape.
	 * 
	 * Formation selection like TT
	 * 
	 * Character fighters should be unique, unlike TT Have different colours!?
	 * Also... the TT portraits are fucking shite
	 * 
	 * Factions that dont hate u will give u presents? If u fuck a faction that
	 * another faction hates, faction 2 will give u an item or a recruit
	 * 
	 * Gota be impossible to unlock all areas and get all recruits in a
	 * playthrough Certain decisions need to eliminate other options Block off
	 * areas (and therefore recruits and items get blocked off too) You should
	 * be given a decent amount of info about what you'll lose when u block off
	 * an area. (This area is high in magical energy and contains the mages
	 * guild... fo e.g.) (So u can guess that u woud have gotten some magic
	 * items and magic recruits if u hadnt blocked it off)
	 * 
	 * Need to give the user lots of information before they make a decision OR
	 * RATHER... make lots of information available to the user if they choose
	 * to find it, read it, use it
	 * "Legend talks of a very powerful hermit mage in the mountains of BLABLABLA"
	 * ... u can infer from that that if u want this mage, maybe dont block up
	 * the area...
	 * 
	 * IF you stop some friendlies from dying they'll come talk to u at the end
	 * of the
	 * 
	 * Talkign to characters during battle AGAIN... if I place the player next
	 * to an enemy they can talk to at the start of the battle and have that
	 * context sensitive button appear on them to show that u cn talk to them...
	 * i dont have to eplain it in a stupid tutorial popup then
	 * 
	 * NEED zooming with the mouse wheel i NEED to zoom al the way in and out.
	 * TT mouse wheel switches players. BULLSHIT.
	 * 
	 * Weird interesting one off objects in levels. not just fucking boring
	 * hests and trees
	 * 
	 * Make status windows and actions windows and shit like that moveable
	 * 
	 * Undo lets u see if u can talk to characters and if u can interact with an
	 * object without getting fucked
	 * 
	 * REVIVE magic... pheonix down... that adds an extra level of complexity
	 * Limited number of phoenix down revive magic costs TONNES of magic...
	 * hmmmmmm make it possible... but EXPENSIVE to carry out
	 * 
	 * When u kill an enemy commander his crew get weak... or run away... and u
	 * have to chase them down
	 * 
	 * A level where u have to chase down fleeing pussies while on horseback. If
	 * u leave them alone and let them all run away u get some sort of reward
	 * 
	 * knocked out neutrals/allies at the start of the battle that u can heal
	 * 
	 * ENCOURAGE EXPERIMENTATION FROM THE PLAYER
	 * 
	 * THe attack preview in TT is WEAK Doesnt seem to tell me if i'll be
	 * counter attacked
	 * 
	 * counter attacks
	 * 
	 * movement after attacks? for all? for horses? for those with the ability?
	 * 
	 * enter/esc for dialogs
	 * 
	 * I think only backstabs adding extra damage and sidestabs not adding extra
	 * damage is good, only having to protext in one cardinal direction is much
	 * more managable
	 * 
	 * Highlight an enemies weaknesses when looking at their stats. SEVERE
	 * WEAKNESS TO FIRE
	 * 
	 * OOOO... elemental shit weakness to fire/electricity/shit
	 * 
	 * Bosses need weaknesses too, otherwise all ur concentration on weaknesses
	 * is bullcrap
	 * 
	 * side mission to remove bosses/factions resistace to X
	 * 
	 * The hover to view info is shite in TT. I want hover to give me shit
	 * tonnes of info or make it configurable how much info is in TOOLTIPS
	 * 
	 * MAKE EVERYTHING CONFIGURABLE SO THAT PEOPLE CANT BLAME U FOR SHIT
	 * 
	 * TT gives u dropped loot for last bad guy u kill rather than just leaving
	 * it there :D
	 * 
	 * STATS Stats at end of each battle Stats in main menu Silly stats Super
	 * specific stats (coz super specific stats are funny in and of
	 * themselves)(chickens stabbed...)
	 * 
	 * At the very leats... when u make life difficult for yourself it will be
	 * very difficult to keep EVERYONE alive :D feeling evil :D
	 * 
	 * A character that's SUPER (189) years old... coz... and they are SUPER
	 * jadded/skeptical
	 * 
	 * NPC i saved refereneced how they would not have survived if it wasnt for
	 * me. NICE TOUCH (TT)
	 * 
	 * People who leave coz of shit you've done happened really annoyingly in
	 * (TT) coz i was too bust helping the oppressed?!?! Maybe she always
	 * leaves? Louise Legerdemain OK... she didnt leave in the end :D ...but put
	 * it in to awesome mark tactics advence
	 * 
	 * A merchant! ok... so they have merchants in TT and Fire Emblem... But
	 * what if i could call my merchant in to battle and if he dies i'm FUCKED.
	 * BUT there's always the option and maybe sometimes theres a reason to
	 * bring him!!!? have "These people respond well to merchants" in the
	 * mission briefing (but something less gay and obvious than that)
	 * 
	 * In the mission briefing, make it obvious enough for the user to work out
	 * who to bring "This is where Steve was born",
	 * "This is where John did a stint as a bar tender"... ETC. Maybe they have
	 * to cross reference the mission briefing with our journal...
	 * "Someone who likes cats will do well here".
	 * 
	 * Quote from TT - "Weapons so sharp they cut their own prices" :D thats
	 * good shit
	 * 
	 * dialouge options with characteres with characters. INCLUDING iteresting
	 * dialogue choices with stock chars (merchants, recruiters) TT - What
	 * interesting deals do u have? - said to a trader
	 * 
	 * I want to have a recruitment agency you can hire from, but make it clear
	 * that every hire is a special one-off hire and u cant just keep going back
	 * w/ money and gettng more and more mages for e.g. Maybe naming them well
	 * and making them expensive and having them talk to u about their alignment
	 * and interests will show that ALL available fromt he get-go, none
	 * unlocked. but cost moooolah
	 * 
	 * Items that give u new abilities (Grappling hook in TT!)
	 * 
	 * When buying there NEEEDS to be a screen that shows each char would
	 * benefit from that armour (TT fucked this)
	 * 
	 * Icon besde each char to show what they are best at Or maybe like...
	 * beside their portrait show an ordered list of what theyre specialities
	 * lie :D SWORD AXE FIREMAGIC BOW ..in icon form, as many as u can fit
	 * 
	 * Another funny line from TT "Do we have to go to the human village"
	 * "Don't call it huan village, just 'village!'" made me think
	 * 
	 * Speach bubbles need to come fromt he character thats talking... TT doesnt
	 * do thsis
	 * 
	 * AND ENTER needs to continue convo... TT doesnt
	 * 
	 * make it obvious that u can convert an enemy thru dialogue
	 * 
	 * ALLOW THE USER TO MAKE DECISION BASED ON THEIR PREFERRED PLAY STYLE (lots
	 * of abilities and leveling options)
	 * 
	 * cpg 0105
	 * 
	 * LEVEL(S) with alarm that tells all of ur peresence its a physical thing
	 * that they can press and u have to stop them getting there it can be
	 * disabled AGAIN... this shit needs to be made clear and obvious to the
	 * user
	 * 
	 * Show enemie's field of view!?
	 * 
	 * Field of view like massive chalice!?
	 * 
	 * IS letting all users do all too musch to take in!?
	 * 
	 * Also... TT battle preview doesnt tell me the chances of one of the chars
	 * being killed doesnt tell me their total health VS damage potential
	 * 
	 * I want to show char lvl and highest stat at all times
	 * 
	 * No mana, just actions per turn, in TT i'm hitting end turn repeatedly
	 * 
	 * Dont force any difficult decision on the player until 1/3 in to the game
	 * Gotta drag them in b4 bombarding them with guilt and death
	 * 
	 * Nee to make clear the counter attack rules, i have no idea whats
	 * happening in TT
	 * 
	 * Gain XP for counters
	 * 
	 * Actually... handle battle like in fire emblem
	 * 
	 * Push/shove should do minor damage, in TT is does none, and maybe lower
	 * their attack/def for the next round
	 * 
	 * U DONT HAVE TO FAIL A MISSION TO WORK OUT WHATS NEEDED mission briefing,
	 * scouting, knowledge, obviousness
	 * 
	 * TT is too hard and harsh and unobvious all it needs is
	 * "We're going to need to save him fast, our presence won't go unnoticed for long"
	 * 
	 * In battle preview show that factions level of hatred/ love towards u an
	 * attack brings the level to neg value (#hatred ;) )
	 * 
	 * Cumultive stats? e.g. add together scouting ability of all allies to
	 * caclulate how much info should be in briefing e.g. add together knowledge
	 * stat of recruits to calculate how much deets should be shown about
	 * enemies
	 * 
	 * Mave text boxes pop up just beside ur char as u walk around, dont pause
	 * play... BASTION DOES THIS?!?! (makes it awkward to read though...)
	 * 
	 * Genetic mutation involved?!
	 * 
	 * SKYRIM - get better at stuff based on how much u use it rather than
	 * choosing on lvl up. (still gonna need to give the user choice for some
	 * stuff .in skyrim perks and magic VS strngth VS dex....
	 * 
	 * Combos or teamwork... (chroma squad)
	 * 
	 * relationships w/ other chars? (fire emblem)
	 * 
	 * MOTEHRFUVKING foreshadowing see people ur gonna meet later see monsters
	 * flutter by that ur gonna fight later
	 * 
	 * Monster murdering contracts (witcher) Also... just contracts in
	 * general... with a jobs boards (witcher)
	 * 
	 * In chroma squad they dont stop moving and it gives me a headached...
	 * (chroma squad)
	 * 
	 * Visit a recruits hometown homestown
	 * 
	 * if u run out of ideas for stories and sidequests just play some rpgs
	 * (oblivion and gta spring to mind)
	 * 
	 * CHroma squad heaps too much on you at the start without giving u info on
	 * how valuable the stats and valus actually are It tells you how much
	 * things will cost and whats stats will be affected without any reference
	 * of what that actually means...
	 * 
	 * autosave obvs
	 * 
	 * If there are specfic objectives they need to be on the screen at all
	 * times and obviously the status of those objecties need to be displayed
	 * display the objectives at all times!!!
	 * 
	 * Random dialog from charactersduring battle, just saying stuff
	 * 
	 * "Hold A to skip to battle" ...which shows up if they tap anything during
	 * a cutscene or dialog
	 * 
	 * SOme chars have unique abilities? like... a ..... "SCANNER" :O (for a
	 * robot, got the idea from chroma squad)
	 * 
	 * Chroma squad and TT arent close enough to top down, makes it hard to
	 * target stuff with the mouse
	 * 
	 * The salesman should be unlocked later down the line, 1/4 thru the game
	 * 
	 * Bonus subobjectives (chroma squad) get u ORGANIC bonus shit Some sort of
	 * ongoing stat to upkeep? like chroma squad? profit? fans? for doing things
	 * a ceratin way? Rating based on ur performance? chroma squad does this
	 * well
	 * 
	 * Teamwork button like chroma squad? or somethimg similar and better?
	 * 
	 * The problem w/ chroma squad is that it's just not clear. The rules need
	 * to be layed out clearly the tricky bit needs to be using those rules to
	 * your advantage, not working out the rules
	 * 
	 * light affecting stealth? areas with no light that bitches can hide in and
	 * surprise attack?
	 * 
	 * Drunk thoughrs....... ehhhhhh.... cars bikes burger stands across the
	 * road pizza place burgers and pizzasshould play a large part beer music
	 * festivals travel graffiti nintendo trading card game pets food for
	 * healing
	 * 
	 * 
	 * It's hard to tell the diff between characters in TT... i should show ->
	 * their lvl, specialities and available weapons on them icon to show if
	 * they can move icon to show if they can attack allow selection of
	 * character that cant do anything AND avatars all need to b different
	 * 
	 * When u kill an enemy u should automatically pick u their loot Chests also
	 * -> open and u get the stuff
	 * 
	 * Button to skip enemy turn
	 * 
	 * option to select counter weapon when attacked
	 * 
	 * Objects that are bigger than a single square. cars, trucks eh...
	 * 
	 * When a car get damaged enough it'll explode in the next turn you can
	 * select the car to see its blast radius (squares it will damage will turn
	 * red) when a car explodes it can damage cars beside it causing chain
	 * reactions have level wiht this... big chain reaction right clicking on an
	 * object will give u info "will explode if it takes enough gamage"
	 * "can be looted" Could have icons for can be looted, destroyed, exploded,
	 * half cover, full cover
	 * 
	 * In like the third or 4th mision in TT there's a fuckin million bad guys u
	 * have to fucking watch moving And my weapons keep breaking and armour does
	 * nothing
	 * 
	 * At one stage maybe ur being chased by a bigger group than urs and u have
	 * to keep pushing on and leveling yourself so that u can eventually turn
	 * and face them
	 * 
	 * Need the weapon and magic triangles.
	 * 
	 * Breaks for saving b4 battles Directly after battles b4 big talkiy bits
	 * after big talky bits
	 * 
	 * in-fighting, where peeps will leace u have to coose someone to keep...
	 * and who has to leave
	 * 
	 * only add 1 or recruits at a time, not 4...
	 * 
	 * u can send an ally off on missions, takes a day do they miss thenext
	 * battle? time snesitive stuff? in 3 days this bar will beattacked....
	 * prepare urself?
	 * 
	 * In save show total play time, leader lvl, .
	 *

	 * 
	 * Always show health of playas
	 * 
	 * Keyboard support in TT is awful
	 * 
	 * Always give u the option to fuck around w/ ur inventory, TT didnt do
	 * this, despite putting in to chatting mode BUT NO TIME TO SORT UR
	 * INVENTORY!!!
	 * 
	 * When u kill a bad guy he drops shit hes picked up Bad guys drop all shit
	 * they were using (should be shitty quality) Bad guys pick up shit on the

	 *

	 * 
	 * each square is... 2x2 metres? just for reference yo...
	 * 
	 * Controls different when there's no baddies? like... directly control
	 * character rather than having a cursor? i think like dragon run?? So... my
	 * thing i have now... it doesnt need to be thrown out
	 * 
	 * try to make the path clever to avoid traps if u can get to the
	 * destination with the same amount of moves?! in the same amount of moves?
	 * 
	 * tap on the character to bring up optios, fuck that menu at the bottom
	 * that TT has also click on object/enemy to interact w/ them
	 * "attack","out of range","open" when u hit attack after click on an enemy

	 * An economy, track money, rather than magically have money appear and
	 * dissappear.
	 * 
	 * You can have all ur characters in a mission, or find other things for
	 * them to do while on the mission. Send your thrief/scout on a recon
	 * mission elsewhere rather than having to protect them in a massive brawl
	 * Make this clear to the user. Same the other way around... if u've got a
	 * stealth mission maybe you only need one person, but your other peeps
	 * could be building defenses, or picking up missed goods, or improving
	 * relations...
	 * 
	 * Stealing shit? (Like... from innocent people... not the baddies...)

	 * Don't settle on a setting til u have to ;) What would work well with the

	 * i'll use tab...
	 * 
	 * 
	 * When THAT person turns to look at u, their body should still be facing

	 * 
	 * a level thats different, messes with lights and shadow
	 * 
	 * maybe everyone wears masks? good way to get around model release, i
	 * wonder if there's a mask museum... at the very least have one character
	 * that wears a mask Is there a photoshop effect for making a mask... out of
	 * a face or something? OR maybe... use masks and try to make them look like
	 * normal human faces... that'd give a really creepy look
	 * 
	 * a disfigured characet maybe the mask character? the character who's
	 * disfigured houldnt be the obvious ones - torturer, fighter etc. maybe
	 * there's a story event where u can convince them to take off their maks
	 * 
	 * ALL SPEACH EVENTS SHOULD END UP WITH SOME STAT GOING UP maybe their

	 * "Kieron’s talked before about how Deus Ex is one of the few games ever to have characters who actually lie to you. Not huge, pantomime deceptions, but little half-truths and tricks delivered deadpan by those you consider to be your friends,"
	 * -- rps Player needs closure it says, need to know who lied and why, is
	 * this true??
	 * "in Pathologic absolutely everybody has an angle, everyone’s bending the truth and trying to twist you round their fingers, and the developers can do this because they have two whole other narratives to explain why."
	 * "As you’re scrambling from one location to the next there are a few buildings which aren’t going to escape your attention. First, there’s the Abattoir. "
	 * "the Polyhedron is a mammoth angular structure resembling an Escher-like interpretation of a conch seashell stuck into the ground by the pointy end. The physics of it are impossible. The town’s children have recently commandeered it, keeping the door locked to everyone except other children."
	 * "A lot of people are aware of the game design trick where you show the player something they can’t access at the beginning of the game, so it sticks in the back of their mind until eventually you grace them with the ability to go back and get it. These buildings in Pathologic take that idea and run with it, sprint with it, go skydiving with it. For most of the game these structures are brooding over you, their contents a dark mystery, and half of everything you learn about the town relates to them in some way."
	 * "For instance, you hear that the meat-men inside the Abattoir think of themselves as an animal brotherhood. And you hear that inmates have been wrenching themselves out of the Aviary’s windows, trying to escape something inside. You hear the smaller children of the Polyhedron have been sent out into the town to gather powders and pills for the big kids. These black rumours are endless, and the more you hear the more fascinating and terrifying these buildings become. Yet as much as you don’t want to go inside them, the fact that you can’t enter them anyway makes them oh-so-intriguing. Ain’t human nature a drag."

	 * Boss ideas :p // This guy has a pacemaker, so zap him - it speeds him up,
	 * but... makes him weak? or puts a timer on him (DOOM) that he'll die in 5
	 * turns? thats quite good Show taht info when u right click on him
	 * "On ELECTRIC ATTACK - Speed x5, Will die in 5 moves from heart failure"
	 * So... this guy gets super fucking fast and dangerous, and u have to avoid
	 * him for 5 moves... or trap him w/ a tank + healer This guy has a
	 * prosthetic arm, freeze it - and it does serious damage while lowering his
	 * attack, coz he cant use his strong metal prosthetic arm :D - special shit
	 * like that Enemy u have to heal to hurt, or at least healing does more
	 * damage than attacking...think of a good reason
	 * 
	 * To give the last boss weaknesses... make him flip between weaknesses...

	 * 
	 * Also btw... cant exclude walking squares from the attack square
	 * calculation, if ur lowest attack range isnt 1 then u cant neccesarily
	 * attack every square u can walk on... Although... if it's walkable isnt it

	 * Is there a better way to display what weapons they can attack with? maybe
	 * put the weapon in their hands or on their backs or hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
	 * 
	 * Divinity original sin style elemental crap
	 * 
	 * Enemies with super duper awesome AOE fuck u up powers
	 * 
	 * Unkillable enemies
	 * 
	 * Shoot a stupid live action video for a trailer
	 * 
	 * Objectives - king of the hill, horde mode, kidnap someone mode (like
	 * capture the flag) Maybe hill isnt objective but gives perks and attaks
	 * enemies (shogun 2) When introducing a new (mode) give them an easy level
	 * to start with so that they can see wats up in a safeish enviroment
	 * 
	 * Combne story mode with a shogun style map domination, but story is always
	 * most important. I'm not sure randomish battles are a good thing in this
	 * type of game. If there are random battles... randomly generate the map
	 * too?
	 * 
	 * Based on your scout ability u get different info about a map. From
	 * suggested lvl, to troop count, to detailed troop count, to treasure info,
	 * to whole map. BUT... the problem with this is, if u fail, you come back
	 * and retry, and you know where everything is. Maybe it could help choosing
	 * what order to do missions in if you have a choice? But same dillema and
	 * ability to cheat... WOULD work well with random maps
	 * 
	 * Doorways block field of view. For the torturer guy, when u go to open the
	 * door - "u hearing screaming on the other side" - "open door", "leave"
	 * 
	 * Hover over weapon icon for info
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Open world? Can quick travel out of battle. Not sure how moving around
	 * works w/ 10 people when ur not in battle
	 * 
	 * Design rules - take the hard MEMORY work away from the player, show them
	 * as much info as you can on the screen so that they can concentrate on
	 * strategy. You have 20 units on the field, your gonna forget and
	 * misremember. I wanna save some of your brain's proccessing power.
	 * 
	 * Show actor lvl on card. V. important. FOR when you want to level the
	 * weakest for e.g.
	 * 
	 * AI that runs away, AI that lures you in, AI that picks someone they dont
	 * liek, ai that goes for chests then leaves (Thieves faction)
	 * 
	 * Ability to send your dudes off the battle field
	 * 
	 * Morale system? Sanity system?
	 * 
	 * Lies and deception. People straight up lie to u without it being obvious.
	 * mislead u. (Dark souls 2 fail forward video.
	 * 
	 * Wathc the RPS fail forward videos and their dev blog entries etc.
	 * 
	 * Play banner saga and the others a bit more.
	 * 
	 * Is my zooming enough? should I configure it so that u can always zoom out
	 * far enough to see the whole battlefield. Or u can zoom forevs and zoom
	 * all the way out to the world map :D Need fog of war then
	 * 
	 * Crosscode start of the demo lets u see in a nice way where you can and
	 * cannot go. Crosscode made it obvious when something was weak to fire, but
	 * it was too obvious. I think for my tutorial a buddy from another faction
	 * should show u how to do some things, as subtle as possible. Maybe if the
	 * user doesnt do what they're supposed after 10 secs tell them in a really
	 * obvious way. The idea is that u see the other guy do stuff that's
	 * unexpected and u'll be like "hmmm... how did he do that", then try it out
	 * urself
	 * 
	 * U shopuld be able to hit/attack enemies, neutrals, allies, ur own team
	 * (dunno why) AOE attacks hurt who? just enemy? enemy + neutral? Everyone?
	 * does AOE attack lower ur standing?
	 * 
	 * Should i force the player into situations where their standing with
	 * another faction could be hurt? (In combat AOE attacks for e.g.)
	 * 
	 * See.. killing allies/neutrals... you'll get EXP for that, level up ur
	 * players faster... BUT everyone will be hostile towards you INTERESTING
	 * PAY OFF SYSTEM, interesting mechanic. Need to highlight it to the user
	 * SUBTLEY.
	 * 
	 * Need to have actor(s) that get pissed off with you and join a different
	 * faction and then u end up fighting them later on
	 * 
	 * Autosave every 10 turns. Notes u pick up that lead u to more missions
	 * (masterplan)
	 * 
	 * Investigative work to find your enemies weaknesses. Maybe one of them is
	 * allergic to something (that's could, i like the allergy angle, it's
	 * light). Look at hitman for interesting killings. Make user have to look
	 * for subtle hints in dialog.
	 * 
	 * Start from different points of view and have the characters come together
	 * (trine, gta)
	 * 
	 * Some of the start peeps should be on their own and some in a group of 2
	 * or 3. What if i do this every time theres a new person? they have their
	 * own mission that you run, before meeting up w/ the team.
	 * 
	 * For peeps images - can i use photos of old paintings or photos of dead
	 * people
	 * 
	 * (Stealth) Camera timing puzzle like master plan. Make it clear where the
	 * camera will turn to on next turn. Ways to get trapped :D
	 * 
	 * (Stealth) Make it clear what areas u are and arent allowed in. Masterplan
	 * kinda does this... (Stealth) if there's any specific requirements for the
	 * mission (even for optional objectives) let it be known (we need 3 people
	 * to carry the cash), masterplan failed to do this.
	 * 
	 * Track stats like trustworthyness (but dont show the player) (Witcher
	 * style, like how it affects Ciri x/5 key points decides whether u make or
	 * break her confidence, so it was tracking her confidence level)
	 * Ramifications come much later. (Witcher) Wrap things up in a light
	 * passive way where possible(Witcher - chick tied to the rock)
	 * 
	 * Rate aggressiveness VS defensiveness VS skill VS strategy VS
	 * trustworthyness (Star hammer)
	 * 
	 * Lists of everything like Dark Dreams Dont Die - food list, notes list,
	 * missions list, bestiary.............
	 * 
	 * Dont have retarded inventory live the witcher. Need more categories.
	 * Switching categories needs to load instantly.
	 * 
	 * Story - woman who proposes to a dude, or had proposed previously. Just a
	 * quirk to add to a female character.
	 * 
	 * Flick through some books on game design, although... blogs and RPS are
	 * probably more interesting, i wonder what Strategies RPS has put under the
	 * microscope, hopefully they'll do a fail forward of TT or something...

	 * When a battle starts grid goes from transparent to opaque

	 * Someone whos an eejit but thinks everyone else is the eejit. (Dougle).
	 * Same w/ someone crazy. L?! :D.
	 * 
	 * Dialog - "Huh?", "I didn't say anything" (L)
	 * 
	 * Write down interesting convos u have w/ real people
	 * 
	 * J - "I need you to focus today, do you get what I'm saying?" ...vague
	 * 
	 * I think for dialog it's very important that it sounds like something
	 * someone would actually say... despite the weird situation. OR if the
	 * person says something weird, the other person has to call it out and
	 * bring it back down to earth (True detective), although in fairness... the
	 * shit the crazy was spouting in true detective wasnt that crazy :DA
	 * 
	 * Beseige is very pretty while still being super simple / minimalistic -
	 * low budget :) less effort :)
	 * 
	 * Shit written on walls/ground like stealth bastard. Text could take up a
	 * whole row of a grid. One word per row. Cool style. "YOUR TURN",
	 * "YOU WIN", "HERO VANQUISHED", "YOU DIED", Dark souls - (BONFIRE LIT, YOU
	 * DIED, YOU DEFEATED), i particularly like bonfire lit, coz it seemed so
	 * retarded. Bloodborne - "Prey Slaughtered" VERY COOL
	 * 
	 * Should the style all be around a cool as grid style? Text
	 * blocky(hmmmmm......)?
	 * 
	 * Animal w/ retarded troll speech? :) (witcher)
	 * 
	 * People or monsters mentioned in passing should show up later. But when
	 * mentioned in passing it should be something memorable (sex, violence,
	 * shock, a quirk (asked a man to marry her, he laughed coz a woman was
	 * asking a man, she ripped his nuts off... that's not bad actually...
	 * IRONIC... coz she made him a woman (say this in a more subtle way :D)))
	 * 
	 * Story - before u meet this lady, u hear that she proposed, he laughed at
	 * her coz of gender roles, she ripped his nuts off, "Ironic really". - is
	 * ironic ok to use here? :D
	 * 
	 * Story - asshole character who goes thru a rough time and comes out more
	 * likeable. (Red baron witcher 3)
	 * 
	 * Open world 2d dragonfall. Would need a huge line fo sight to avoid
	 * fights. Line of sight could be in the upgrade list. (START WITH NOTHING)
	 * 
	 * When you get in to a fight ur units line up in a formation that u have
	 * specified previously. Game remembers the last formation u picked...
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Need interesting lvling system - FF10 (endless cavern 2 had similar),
	 * witcher 3, perks from fallout. Witcher 3 slots and powers system would be
	 * great if u could make up set for VS magic, VS monsters, VS fire then pick
	 * one b4 each mission. Weird perks like the ant in fallout or the vampire
	 * in skyrim.
	 * 
	 * With the scouting power u could be alerted to battle events that will
	 * happen later on - 5 enemies will enter from the east on turn 5 (like that
	 * TT mission where you are protecting ur tent), also, could have markers on
	 * the edge of the map with a countdown to their arrival. In FE i think u
	 * could block their arrival by standing on the square where they spawn.
	 * 
	 * Random awkward powers that people will use in interesting ways. Not just
	 * boring convenient powers. Bombs that u can only throw northeast :D
	 * 
	 * i like the way in witcher i can see all craftables, powers etc. even when
	 * i can't make/use/unlock them yet
	 * 
	 * All those loads and loads of number and bars and stops and icons need
	 * config - always hide, show on hover, show on click, always show
	 * 
	 * Maybe show all controls on screen and have a config to turn them off?! :/
	 * 
	 * It's not an army... its a troupe or some shit.
	 * 
	 * Add tactical games to ur steam library so that if u ever make it to steam
	 * people will think ur cool
	 * 
	 * What is steam greenlight? How do u get on steam?
	 * http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/about/?appid=765&section=faq
	 * Greenlight is basically the submission process for anyone who hasnt
	 * published on steam before. SHit on greenligh looks FUCKING BORING videos
	 * with text like "solve puzzles", "follow your brother" JESUS Did telepath
	 * tactics go through greenlight? Need to be different enough from telepath
	 * tactics. A nice style would be step one. And find ALL the things they
	 * fucked up adn do it right. 1. It's minging. 2. It's the same fucking
	 * setting as always (medieval magic bollox). 3. Identical fucking units.
	 * 
	 * // Is there a better way to display what weapons they can attack with?
	 * maybe put the weapon in their hands or on their backs or hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

	 * what way do counter attacks work? counter if u havent attacked in ur
	 * turn? counter always? counter with best weapon? counter with what u used
	 * last (FE)? See what the others do?
	 * 
	 * I feel like i'm taking out a lot of complexities - direction facing,
	 * countering w/ last used weapon, all characters being able to use all
	 * weapons (to varying degrees... am i over-simplifying? Should I go with
	 * the more complex versions of rules? Should I go with what feels like a
	 * realistic representation of a real battle? I know I personally hate the
	 * complicated parts :D, but I think it's what most fans would go for. that
	 * super hero one (wtf was it called) was overly simple and boring. Maybe I

	 * 
	 * In the settings show a preview of what shit will look like w/ UI elements
	 * turned on/off, I am a genius :D Can have a UI section in the settings.
	 * Call it... User Interface? Screen? Battle Screen? See what other games
	 * call it.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * I like the idea of being able to evacuate bitches from the battlefield,
	 * helps keep them alive
	 * 
	 * Need to manage item flow so that ur not going to the shop to sell off ur
	 * shit all the time. SO BORING. I like the way TT let u send extra items to
	 * storage. Also, break items down in to LOTS of categories.
	 * 
	 * Name all characters, even foot soldiers. From:
	 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem_Awakening#Development
	 * 
	 * Give the actor's images props? "While designing (APPEARANCE) the
	 * characters, Kozaki took their backstories into account: for example,
	 * Gaius was drawn with a sack of sweets as he had a love for them."
	 * 
	 * Difficulty levels? Casual mode (no perma-death)? Change level difficulty
	 * on the fly? "One of the more controversial ideas that made it into the
	 * final game was the Causal Mode . Initially opposed by staff members at
	 * Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, Yamagami and others successfully
	 * defended the feature. Yamagami's stance was that modern gamers would not
	 * be pleased with needing to invest extra time because a character had
	 * died." From:
	 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem_Awakening#Development
	 * 
	 * FE:A review - Despite feeling mixed about the interface and multiplayer,
	 * GameSpot's Heidi Kemps called Awakening the best installment in the
	 * series for some time.[51] From:
	 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem_Awakening#Development
	 * 
	 * FE:A review - Awakening made me scratch and claw for victory, and I
	 * savored every moment [52] From:
	 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem_Awakening#Development
	 * 
	 * Health bar flashes when ur fucked, on/off configurable, % at which it
	 * flashes configurable
	 * 
	 * Actual playable area on the settings screen with everything on the
	 * screen. For you to try out settings. Can go between full screen and half
	 * screen (w/ other half showing settings). Put everything on the test map
	 * (multiple factions, chars, objs, starting w/ variable weapons, no
	 * weapons, one weapon, health levels)
	 * 
	 * Utility items - spafe, pickaxe, tree axe - better at clearing objs than
	 * normal weapons
	 * 
	 * All weapons and inventory items need short descriptions, be hilarious
	 * 
	 * Weapons more effective at certain ranges? Super long-bows (sniper rifles)
	 * a game breaker? siege weapons?
	 * 
	 * Level with a sniper, and you've got to take cover from him as you make
	 * your way to him. a cone of light shows where he can and cannot shoot.
	 * Some cover moves. NEED COVER :D
	 * 
	 * POWs different sizes. Graze pow could be tiny, "SUPER EFFECTIVE",
	 * "CRITICAL" could be massive, bigger than a square.
	 * 
	 * Don't use normal words like "critical". If at all possivle.altho this
	 * might just make things confusing :/
	 * 
	 * Starting with super-strong character? Basically a body guard (FE)
	 * 
	 * What about seeing the hand/mouse of the other factions doing stuff? For
	 * tutorial? All the time? Even when it's not their turn. And if you take
	 * too long to make a move they could shake vigourously or circle a player,
	 * or 'draw' patterns (figure of 8) to get your attention. Could make this
	 * configurable.
	 * 
	 * How does shogun get away with tiny icons?! :D
	 * 
	 * Order weapons in the side bar by how much damamge they do based on player
	 * wepaon combo
	 * 
	 * Levels of organisation ai, make it clear in briefing that theyre
	 * organised or not or a bit. Organised factions have faction level goals -
	 * protect X, kill Y, be defensive, target weak, hold back and let other
	 * factions kill eachother. Mission summary needs to describe these in some
	 * way.
	 * 
	 * With multiple factions in a brawl. u can hold back... but u'll miss out
	 * on xp :D i like this TRADE OFF.
	 * 
	 * // Shit written on walls/ground like stealth bastard. Text could take up
	 * a whole row of a grid. One word per row. Cool style. "YOUR TURN",
	 * "YOU WIN", "HERO VANQUISHED", "YOU DIED", Dark souls - (BONFIRE LIT, YOU
	 * DIED, YOU DEFEATED), i particularly like bonfire lit, coz it seemed so
	 * retarded. Bloodborne - "Prey Slaughtered" VERY COOL
	 * 
	 * Level where all the eneimes make a beeline straight for a spcific
	 * character. Maybe the mission is about the character. It needs to be clear
	 * in the briefing that this will happen. Do a mass effect 2 style mission
	 * for each character?
	 * 
	 * Traders give you discounts, gifts, offer items they wouldnt normally if
	 * they like you. They could be tied to a faction and that decides how much
	 * they like you.
	 * 
	 * BRANDS :D - defo need a coffee company and a delivery compant and an
	 * internet company
	 * 
	 * Drinks that are all different. Each could be a different type of coffee.
	 * Look at the coffee.jp blog
	 * 
	 * Food that heals you? Drinks to regain mana? Do we have mana?
	 * 
	 * Look up best scifi films. Fifht element "Multipass". Could have a
	 * simpleton like her (ogres in witcher)
	 * 
	 * 2 battles at the same time, where you have to split your forces, and
	 * every turn it switches between the two :D (Technical implementation -
	 * could have them on same board, just with a massive gap in the board... to
	 * split the two battles.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Specific type of enemy unit always goes fro specific unit type. e.g.
	 * Priests always go for vampires.
	 * 
	 * NEW stars next to new items
	 * 
	 * Setup own categories and list of items (like a playlist) - right click on
	 * sword, add to list > new list, "try out", "keep"
	 * 
	 * Sell junk option, ability to mark items as junk. Will i have junk? I like
	 * items (daimonds, gold nuggets) that u can sell for lots of money. Or it
	 * could be tech stuff... where u have to choose whether to seel or use to
	 * improve wepaons and shit.
	 * 
	 * Use a fecking name thats fecking easy to find ENEMY is not a good name
	 * for a game. It's cool, but not searchable.
	 * 
	 * Is finding the enemy part of the game? XCOM VS FE. fuck new xcom
	 * though... those bastards just popped up out of nowhere.
	 * 
	 * Tech tree?
	 * 
	 * you manage research, funding, spending, satellites, UFO tracking, UFO
	 * intercepting???? (XCOM) - these ARE my fave bits of shogun...
	 * 
	 * Battle brothers - in the city it's unclear what bits u can click on BB -
	 * troops have a daily cost, but i cant see my daily income, do i have one?
	 * BB - When recuiting i couldnt see the units deets - just cost BB - no
	 * compare for items in stash FML BB - there's a scout report before battle
	 * :) "ur scout has reported seeing some bandit thugs, a bandit marksman",
	 * with option to engage or cancel, would like more details (my game will
	 * show more details based on ur scout stats), twist - it said there'd be a
	 * marksman, but i dont see one... that is interesting though, innacurate
	 * scout reports... as long as the player knows its innacurate. O wait...
	 * there is an archer, but hes a "hideen opponent". BB - i'm having trouble
	 * who does what at a glance... BB - the turn system is like niormal RPGs, u
	 * dont get to choose who goes when
	 * 
	 * Comparison of you to challenge/mission/battle/map - if u have the
	 * scouting ability up high enough
	 * 
	 * I want u to start with nothing. not a map, not a notion of what's
	 * happening.
	 * 
	 * BB - shows nice stats screen at end of game. BB - started of much too
	 * difficult, bit of a learning curve would be nice
	 * 
	 * BB- animations of attacks and misses are nice and simple and easy
	 * 
	 * Tooltips on loading screens should shed light on the subtleties of the
	 * game. [Click to continue]
	 * 
	 * BB - gives u list of quests, no mention of difficulty on the quest, u
	 * only know after u've accepted it and u see the enemy and beside the enemy
	 * it says [IMPOSSIBLE]
	 * 
	 * BB - shows + and - on fight preview e.g. -height disadvantage, +height
	 * advantage
	 * 
	 * BB - on first fucking mission i didnt realise I had to hit "LOOT ALL" to
	 * get the items, left the whole thing behing. There really should have been
	 * a pop-up saying "Are u sure u dont want to loot anything?"
	 * 
	 * BB - the lack of compare is really making it unplayable. Loads of loot,
	 * no compare.
	 * 
	 * BB - a tool tip informed me that accuracy drps with distance.
	 * 
	 * Why are they all the same fucking setting??!
	 * 
	 * If I have a tutorial section it should be under it's own heading on the
	 * main menu, not under "scenarios". Will i have a tutorial section? Could
	 * put it all at the start of the campaign? Or... make the first few
	 * missions skippable "Is this your first playthrough of TACTICS!!!!?"
	 * 
	 * a siege lvl. no idea what that entails. could totally work in a
	 * modern/future setting ;)
	 * 
	 * BB - has retreating, tooltip said to get to the edge of the map b4 trying
	 * to retreat
	 * 
	 * BB - only one weapon, shown as icon on character, equip system is like
	 * real rpg, which is fine as long as u dont have too many units to equip,
	 * would love if it showed lvl on battle screen
	 * 
	 * BB - each character has a bag which allows them to carry stuff, so i
	 * guess they can switch weapon. They can upgrade to have more bag slots.
	 * 
	 * BB - little bushes to hid in work quite well
	 * 
	 * BB - armor and health bars
	 * 
	 * BB - too many oneshots for my liking.
	 * 
	 * BB - cool permanent perk-like attributes - founding member (+5 attack),
	 * disloyal, coward (this is like crusader kings)
	 * 
	 * BB - has retreat from combat button, makes all chars run away
	 * 
	 * BB - spending ages chasing fucking archers down when they're the last one
	 * left
	 * 
	 * BB - on the statistics and loot screen at the end of the battle it should
	 * really start on the loot screen, they're just asking for u to forget to
	 * loot, actually... everything should be auto-looted anyway in fairness.
	 * 
	 * I want to have quite a bit of loot in the game, BB reinded me of how fun
	 * it is.
	 * 
	 * BB - time passes while ur not moving >:O, which i guess is for the other
	 * units to move around freely, still gay tho
	 * 
	 * BB - no real direction. i want a bit of direction. u shouldnt have to
	 * follow it, but it's nice to have. Need a bit of direction, for if ur at a
	 * loss of what to do, and that bit of direction should lead u past other
	 * shit that might grab ur attention.
	 * 
	 * BB - as ur wandering around u reveal locations. v. cool
	 * 
	 * BB - every fucking missin i get is impossible, there needs to be circles
	 * of difficulty moving out from the starting point
	 * 
	 * BB - i dont know the enemies health - so who it's worth hitting.
	 * 
	 * BB - there's just nothing keeping me playing. No direction. No drive. Not
	 * much is explained properly. They move too slow on the map screen. MAYBE,
	 * time should move quicker when ur moving and slow down when ur not? OOOOR
	 * manual speed controls (Shogun, aoe2)
	 * 
	 * BB - i do like the living worl they try to portray with the caravans and
	 * the guards moving around. random units moving around too would be cool,
	 * that u can hire or whatever.
	 * 
	 * Could have HUGE dragonrun-style levels that kind of force you to split ur
	 * time up in some way. OR u have to concurrent missions, so have to split
	 * ur team up. OR u split up at the start and both teams enter from
	 * different directions.
	 * 
	 * BB - awkward to see shit
	 * 
	 * BB - awkward to know whereu can move
	 * 
	 * mission where urteam starts off circling the enemy, ur ambushing them.
	 * make it a super easy one where enemy has the attribute (drowsy) and
	 * they're not wearing full armor
	 * 
	 * Special powers.... in BB they are always like 23% chance to hit, use all
	 * ur action points. I think they should be easier to hit, but have a
	 * recharge time (Kings bounty)
	 * 
	 * Interesting stats like sanity, willpower, fatigue, happiness, equality,
	 * lonliness, boredom, thrist, hunger, energy, fear,
	 * 
	 * How am i doing energy? Travel distance + 1 attack (FE)? Moving and
	 * attacking costs stamina (BB)?
	 * 
	 * 
	 * different attack text based on weapon type - slashed, shot, blugeoned,
	 * gored
	 * 
	 * I like the dead bodies in BB
	 * 
	 * Map where u're racing with a 3rd party to get to the middle of a level,
	 * you both arrive at different entrances
	 * 
	 * Level(s) where you set up defenses? Need to know where enemy will come
	 * from maybe though...
	 * 
	 * The dumpsters are too perfectly centered in the squares
	 * 
	 * log text can probably be bigger (the images are shite at the moment, too
	 * small), will they really care about more than the last 5 log msgs
	 * anyway?!
	 * 
	 * http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/06/26/fast-travel-is-rubbish/ At the
	 * end of Dragon Age: Origins, for example, you get a rundown of all the
	 * decisions you’ve made – a kind of record of your life as it occurred.
	 * It’s small but it’s something. In Crusader Kings II they recently added a
	 * feature that posts a post-game chronicle of your entire dynasty when your
	 * game ends – a brilliant move.
	 * 
	 * Short cuts between areas as u progress (dark souls)
	 * 
	 * On morrowind fast travel - I think the Bunnyhop youtube guy highlighted
	 * how neat the way travel progressed in Morrowind. Something along the
	 * lines of “at the start of the game you had to take the bus like everyone
	 * else, by the end of the game you could fly
	 * 
	 * Entirely controllable by mouse and/or keyboard and/or joypad. buttons
	 * around the edge of the screen.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * FIGHT fist icon - could also use HEAL, FIGHT, PUSH...
	 * 
	 * Super spells like armour princess?
	 * 
	 * I want an investigation!!! look in to her story, black closet... RPS must
	 * ref some serious mystery/investigation games. PHEONIX WRIGHT :P (which
	 * was BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!)
	 * 
	 * Clouds when u zoom out far enough! :D (skyrim)
	 * 
	 * Open worl with blocked off interior areas, but fights can happen int he
	 * open areas. AND make the switch to the indoor areas completely seemless
	 * (withcer). LOL... no biggy...
	 * 
	 * For testing - use monkey or omething similar to just hammer the shit out
	 * of the game. (remember to disable the exit button :D)
	 * 
	 * Teleptah tactics cost 14.99, CHroma SQuad cost 14:99, Fallen: A2P
	 * Protocol is 14.99 (Early access)
	 * 
	 * When releasing, check the calendar for similar games, check the calendar
	 * for big games, don't release near steam winter/summer sale time
	 * 
	 * WTF is Disgaea?
	 * 
	 * Mention fire emblem, shadowrun ETC. in the game's description the way
	 * that telepath tactics does, coz then if someone searches for those it'll
	 * show up ur game too ;) - "The indie lovechild of Fire Emblem and Disgaea,
	 * Telepath Tactics is a strategy RPG with destructible battlefields,
	 * bridge- and barricade-building, and the ability to fling enemies off
	 * cliffs and into lava. "
	 * 
	 * Could go around on a bus and take loads of photos and construct a city
	 * myself :D (i dont think i'd be quite at the correct height though...
	 * 
	 * Probably need to show relationships somewhere on the screen (i mean
	 * faction to faction relationships)
	 * 
	 * I could do the teamup shite that they do in FE:A, but show hearts or
	 * something on characters that the currently selected character can team
	 * up. Rather than having to remember the fucking interweaving relationships
	 * of 15 different fucking characters. Also... it was very synthetic - can
	 * only have 3 relationships, no negative relationships, only one intimate
	 * relationship. Just not very natural...
	 * 
	 * Water, lava, trap, dangerous squares (for pushing fun times)
	 * 
	 * Make the dialog interesting and dynamic - interruptions, expressions,
	 * shouting, whispering, colours, images (zelda...)
	 * 
	 * Have script events where the player can keep playing
	 * 
	 * Dialog where the players on the field talk, rather than their profile
	 * images talking, and they can move around while this is happening. EPIC.
	 * 
	 * I used the overly detailed hover preview for real :D
	 * 
	 * Some sort of time travel, time manipulation, time control aspect?
	 * PRIMER!!
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * I like these designs http://imgur.com/a/erEXz
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Look for things that have square grids, use them in artwork
	 * http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/07/10/the-flare-path-hex-interview/
	 * http
	 * ://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/07/09/co-op-christening-the-behemoths
	 * -game-4-is-pit-people/ chcocolate graphpaper photoboothphotos sudoku
	 * goldengrahams/shreddies/cereal chess/draftsboard tablecloth fishnet,
	 * also... just take some square shit and order them in to a grid, will do
	 * for loading screens or whatevs
	 * 
	 * watch the fire emblem battle animations, the 3d ones are pretty good one
	 * where the screen turned red and black...
	 * 
	 * Make pause game on minimize and option
