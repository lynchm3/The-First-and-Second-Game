	// BATTLE MECHANICS BROAD PLAN
	// 1. Design the most basic simplified, easy turn based strategy as
	// possible.
	// 2. Add intricacies which can be turned on/off with a config
	// 3. Hone

	// show as musch info as possible to the user, but without cluttering
	// reasoning - like... when they don't compare weapons for you... fucking
	// bullshit (maybe I could word this reasoning better?) :D

	// add lots of subtleties and complexities as possible, but again, without
	// it becoming cluttered ;)
	// reasoning - subleties add depth, without the depth the game is just
	// fucking boring

	// NEED original ideas, there's loads of these games. And I'm modeling on
	// them hard, but at what stage am i gonna add my own stuff?
